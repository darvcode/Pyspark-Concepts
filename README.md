# PySpark Concepts: Real Estate Data Analysis

Welcome to the **PySpark Concepts** project. This repository is designed to help beginners (including myself) get hands-on experience with PySpark by working through various data analysis tasks using a real estate dataset from Kaggle. The goal is to understand the basics of PySpark, how it compares to SQL, and how it integrates with other Python libraries.

## Project Overview

In this project, we use PySpark to explore and analyze a real estate dataset from the USA. The dataset contains information about properties, including prices, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, house sizes, and more. Through a series of steps, we clean, transform, analyze, and visualize this data, all while learning essential PySpark concepts.

## Steps Covered in the Project

### 1. **Data Loading and Initial Exploration**
   - **Goal:** Load the real estate dataset and understand its structure.
   - **PySpark Concepts:** `spark.read.csv`, `printSchema`, `show`.

### 2. **Data Cleaning and Transformation**
   - **Goal:** Clean the data by handling missing values, filtering records, and creating new features.
   - **PySpark Concepts:** `select`, `dropna`, `withColumn`, `filter`, `count`.

### 3. **Data Aggregation**
   - **Goal:** Aggregate the data to calculate average prices and house sizes based on the number of bedrooms.
   - **PySpark Concepts:** `groupBy`, `agg`, `avg`, `orderBy`.

### 4. **Price Trends and Distribution Analysis**
   - **Goal:** Analyze price trends and distributions across different states.
   - **PySpark Concepts:** `groupBy`, `agg`, `orderBy`, `when`, `withColumn`.

### 5. **Visualizing Data with Matplotlib and Seaborn**
   - **Goal:** Convert PySpark DataFrame to Pandas for visualization and create plots to understand data distributions and relationships.
   - **Concepts:** `toPandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`.

### 6. **Building a Machine Learning Model**
   - **Goal:** Build a simple Linear Regression model to predict property prices based on features like the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and house size.
   - **PySpark Concepts:** `VectorAssembler`, `LinearRegression`, `train_test_split`, `fit`, `evaluate`.

### Extra: **SQL vs. PySpark Comparison**
   - **Goal:** Understand how SQL queries translate to PySpark code.
   - **Concepts:** `createOrReplaceTempView`, `spark.sql`, `select`, `filter`, `agg`.

## Steps to Use This Project on Kaggle:

1. **Download the Notebook**:
   - Locate the notebook file (`pyspark-concepts-real-state.ipynb`).
   - Download the notebook to your local machine.

2. **Upload to Kaggle**:
   - Log in to your Kaggle account.
   - Navigate to the "Notebooks" section > new Notebook > upload the downloaded `.ipynb` file.

3. **Dataset Setup**:
   - Upload the dataset to Kaggle or add it on the right panel in your Notebook `(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ahmedshahriarsakib/usa-real-estate-dataset)`.
   -Unfortunately, the dataset is too large to upload to this repository.

5. **Run the Notebook**:
   - Execute the cells in the notebook sequentially.
   - Explore and modify the code to deepen your understanding of PySpark concepts.

This project is an starting point for anyone looking to get hands on experience with PySpark. It covers data cleaning, transformation, visualization, and even basic machine learning, all within the PySpark framework.
